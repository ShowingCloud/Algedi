## 🔍 Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Database Migrations
- ✅ Add pgvector extension (script provided: `packages/ai-editor/scripts/setup-pgvector.sql`)
- ✅ Add billing models (BillingCycle, UsageRecord) - Added to commerce schema
- [ ] Add FineTuningJob model
- [ ] Add Campaign model

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Redis setup for BullMQ (configured in worker script and factory)
- [ ] Object storage (S3/R2) for assets - structure exists, needs S3/R2 integration
- [ ] Connection pooling (PgBouncer/Prisma Accelerate) - Recommended for production
- ✅ Worker deployment strategy (standalone script: `apps/platform/scripts/start-worker.ts`)

### Security
- [ ] Token exchange auth pattern
- [ ] RLS policies (if using PostgreSQL RLS)
- [ ] API rate limiting
- ✅ Webhook signature verification (implemented in Stripe webhook handler)

---

## 📝 Notes

1. **v4 is authoritative** for FSP pattern and Next.js 15 features
2. **v3 is authoritative** for billing infrastructure details
3. **v2 concepts** remain valid but adapt to current schema
4. **v1 MedusaJS references** should be ignored (we use custom commerce)

5. **Consistent patterns across versions:**
   - Shadow DOM ✅
   - data-component-id ✅
   - Zod schemas ✅
   - Multi-tenancy ✅
   - Async processing ✅ (fully implemented)
   - Billing ✅ (credits + Stripe Connect implemented)

---

## 🎯 Quick Wins (Can be done immediately)

1. ✅ **Route Factory Pattern** - ✅ Completed
2. ✅ **Worker Execution Script** - ✅ Completed (`start-worker.ts`)
3. ✅ **Prompt Builder UI** - ✅ Completed
4. ✅ **Job Status Polling** - ✅ Completed (JobStatusPolling component)
5. **Theme JSON Schema** - Define in CMS package (Remaining)
